# Action Transfer

We provide a simple script for action transfer in `sample.py`. You can also create the target video list from various data source and shuffle them randomly to see different action transfer results across contexts.

We also provide a script for video quality evaluation in `lam/eval.py`. To evaluate FVD and ECS, please download the pretrained [I3D](https://github.com/SongweiGe/TATS/blob/main/tats/fvd/i3d_pretrained_400.pt) model first and reset the path in `worldmodel/fvd_utils/fvd_utils.py`.
